# RL-Epidemic-Control-Networks

> A reinforcement learning framework for learning interpretable social policies to mitigate epidemic spread over dynamic contact networks using SEIR models and Proximal Policy Optimization.

## üìö Project Overview

This project explores whether an intelligent agent can learn to mitigate epidemic spread by applying high-level, interpretable social policies‚Äîsuch as quarantine or moderate distancing‚Äîon a dynamic population graph, without micromanaging individual behavior. The model integrates:

- **SEIR-based epidemic modeling**
  **Graph-Based Simulation**  
- **Network rewiring dynamics**
- **Reinforcement learning via PPO**

The goal is to discover strategies that effectively balance public health outcomes with the preservation of social connectivity.

## üß™ Methodology

1. **Epidemic Modeling**  
   The SEIR model is used to simulate infection dynamics. An extended SEIR-TTI (Test, Trace, Isolate) model is also implemented for realism.

2. **Graph-Based Simulation**  
   Network-based spread is simulated using the `EoN` (Epidemics on Networks) library with stochastic Gillespie dynamics. Graph topologies include:
   - Random Regular Graphs
   - Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi
   - Watts‚ÄìStrogatz (default)

3. **Policy-Based Rewiring**  
   Four discrete social strategies simulate public policy:
   - `normal`
   - `moderate_distancing`
   - `strict_distancing`
   - `quarantine`

4. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent from `Stable-Baselines3` is trained to select policies based on compact observations of the epidemic and network state. The environment is built using `Gymnasium`.

## üì¶ Requirements

Being Jupyter notebooks, all the requirements are present in the first cells. If you encounter any error, check that the output cell for TensorBoard is not specific to Kaggle/Colab, since training has been done on them mainly.
